This was originally just supposed to be a simple problem, but I took it too far then ended up turning in it into a project.

It is supposed to replace any spaces with the clap emoji. And you can shoose to add more or less to the end of the sentence. 

For example: If you can't handle me at my worst then you don't deserve me at my best

This will turn to: 👏👏If👏you👏can't👏handle👏me👏at👏my👏worst👏then👏you👏don't👏deserve👏me👏at👏my👏best👏👏
